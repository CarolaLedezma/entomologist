The goal of Entomologist is to provide a cross-platform desktop interface to various bug trackers.

The desktop version is written with Qt/C++, and requires Qt >= 4.6 to compile.  You'll find the source code in the desktop/ directory.

The mobile version is written in Java using the Android SDK, and should work for any target above API level 8.  You'll find the source code in the mobile/ directory.
