The goal of Entomologist was to provide a cross-platform desktop interface to various bug trackers. It is no longer in development.

The desktop version was written with Qt/C++, and requires Qt >= 4.6 to compile.  You'll find the source code in the desktop/ directory.

The mobile version was written in Java using the Android SDK, and should work for any target above API level 8.  You'll find the source code in the mobile/ directory.
