In order to install, you'll need Qt >= 4.4 and QJson

Steps for installation:

Linux:
 $ qmake
 $ make
 % make install

Mac OS X:
For Mac OS X you'll need to install the QtSDK or QtLibs from the official QtWebsite to compile.
Packages from Homebrew/Macports won't be as updated or clean as the official ones.

Once you have this installed you should be able to run:
 $ qmake
 $ make
 $ make install

which should then build a .app bundle that you can run for entomologist or add it to your applications folder as you normally would.
If you want to make it work across multiple instances of Mac OS X without installing Qt on each you can use macdeployqt to add the required libraries/frameworks to the .app bundle so it can run without Qt being installed. 

Windows:
For Windows the easiest compliation procedure is to use QTCreator and the QTSDK to compile the binary. Once you have the binary compiled you can
make it run by adding the following .dlls to the same directory as your .exe. If you have multiple instances you'll have to find the right ones that
Qt used to compile the application which, if you have the QtSDK installed, should be the ones in QtSDK\Desktop\Qt\versionofQt\mingw.

Required dlls:
 - QtCore4.dll
 - QtGui4.dll
 - QtNetwork4.dll
 - QtXML4.dll
 - QtSql4.dll
 - libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
 - mingwm10.dll

 You'll also need to put the qsqlite4.dll database driver into a directory called sqldrivers. Once you have done this you can move the directory
 to where you would like to keep it and the application should run.
